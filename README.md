# minimal.nvim

This is a demo config to show that only a few plugins and a single file are
needed to get quite an effective neovim setup.

In total this took maybe 20 minutes to put together, at the end of the day
most of it is copy-paste and change a few options.

Right now, this only has support for Lua, but a few lines can be uncommented
to get Golang support.
